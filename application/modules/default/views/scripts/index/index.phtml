		<p class="pragraph-first gap">The issue of foreign aid transparency and aid effectiveness has been a topic of debate and discussion at an international level since quite some time.</p>

		<p class="pragraph-second gap">Making aid data openly available in uniform standard format both from donors and recipients is a vital step in making foreign  aid more transparent. This open availability of aid data enables individuals and organisations to access aid data , analyse them and ask questions regarding proper implementation of aid driven activities which and hence enhances aid effectiveness and accountability. </p>
						
		<p class="pragraph-second">International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) is one such format endorsed by many countries, governments and donor agencies. This comprehensive format of publishing aid data is envisioned to be used by both donor agencies and reporting organisations. However, there seems to be an acute need of a platform to expedite the process of entering and publishing the aid data.</p>

		<p class="pragraph-second">AidStream stands as one such platform, that presents complexity of the <a href="http://iatistandard.org" target="_blank">IATI</a> in understandable and consumable way.

All that needs to be done is to register into the system, enter the data and publish it. The data will be easily published to the <a href="http://iatiregistry.org" target="_blank">IATI registry </a>. In addition, AidStream guarantees high security, proper maintenance and easy accessability of the aid data.</p></div>
